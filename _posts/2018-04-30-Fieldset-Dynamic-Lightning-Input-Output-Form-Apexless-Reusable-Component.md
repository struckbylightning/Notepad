Are you using LeX?
Do you need to show few input fields only on basis of certain filter criteria (can`t create new recordtype)?
Want to  have flexibility to add/remove/reorder the displayed fields?
Also need flexibility to change the title/icon of the form component?
Added flexibility of having the form support both output(read-only) / input(Create / Update) will not hurt?

If answer to above question is yes look no further, below component is match made in heaven.

You`ll be able to declare fields in fieldset and leaverage appbuilder to drag and configure the components onto the record pages you wish, just that simple!
