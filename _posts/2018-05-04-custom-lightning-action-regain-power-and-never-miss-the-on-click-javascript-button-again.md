## Cheers to the Future - Custom Lightning Action

I know despite of what Salesforce says [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2016/10/your-new-life-with-lightning-actions-smart-fast-and-mobile.html) to [Break Up with JavaScript Buttons and Embrace Lightning](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/?p=157981&preview=true) and suggests the [First Steps: to replace JavaScript Buttons](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2016/09/take-the-first-steps-ways-you-can-replace-javascript-buttons.html)
-[with Lightning Actions( because they are Smart, Fast, and Mobile](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2016/10/your-new-life-with-lightning-actions-smart-fast-and-mobile.html), we all continue to miss our mighty old friends(On-Click Javascript buttons) when we run into situations highlted below when despite of all suggested we are still unsure of the way out,

#### Needing to do following currently hurts as there\`s no straight forward to perform the below listed seemingly simple tasks,

- Button with simple 'Are you sure?' confirm box.
- Button which does conditional redirection.
- Button that simply does API callouts to external system (no UI required!)
- Button which opens up a prefilled form.
- Button which just calls an Apex method to do the needfull.
- Button that can leverage the power of OOB [events that are handled in the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/events_one.htm) 
- Button that can redirect to another Lightning Component or open up the component inside a modal.

Yes I know it hurts and that\`s why 'customLightningAction.cmp' is created, which allows you to drag and drop it onto any record detail page and then configure the following design parameters to suit your need.
