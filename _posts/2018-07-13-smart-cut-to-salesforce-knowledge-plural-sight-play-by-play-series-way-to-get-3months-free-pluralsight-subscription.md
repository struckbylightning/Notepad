## Smart-cut to Salesforce Knowledge

Smartest way to gain knowledge is to learn via experience (not just yours, but also of others).

I vividly remember having fun learning Salesforce by watching ChrisBarry\`s DEV 401/501 courses 6 years back, since then none of the salesforce educational video series have impressed me enough.

Untill now when I came accross [Salesforce Play by Play series on Pluralsight by Don Robbins](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/search?i=1&m_Sort=relevance&q=play+by+play&q1=course&q2=salesforce&x1=categories&x2=tools), which got me immediately hooked as you get a chance to gain first hand knowledge from the folks who have BEEN there, DONE that.

Incase you have doubts on how good they are try 1month free pluralsight subscription or follow below steps to get 3/6 months subscriptions
