## Smartest way to gain knowledge is to learn via experience (not just yours, but also of others).

I vividly remember having fun learning Salesforce by watching Chris Barry\`s DEV 401/501 courses 6 years back, since then none of the salesforce educational video series have impressed me enough;

Until now when I came across [Salesforce Play by Play series on Pluralsight by Don Robbins](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/search?i=1&m_Sort=relevance&q=play+by+play&q1=course&q2=salesforce&x1=categories&x2=tools), which got me immediately hooked as it gives a chance to gain first-hand knowledge from the folks who have BEEN there, DONE that.

In case you have doubts on how good they are, try 1 month free pluralsight subscription or follow below steps to get 3/6 months subscriptions (via crunchadeal.com).

1. Head over to pluralsight.com
2. Create a Microsoft live account from here. You don’t have to create one if you already have one.
3. Now, go to https://my.visualstudio.com and create an account with your Microsoft live id.
4. You will see the visual studio dev essentials page with pluralsight 6 months subscription option.
5. Click “Get Coupon” option and then click activate link as shown in the image below.
pluralsight-free
6. Once activated, you will be taken to the pluralsight website. Sign up using your email and you will get six months of free subscription.
