My name is **Saurabh Shrivastava**, and this is my personal blog. I am an Information Technology Engineering undergraduate student at [Institute of Engineering & Technology, DAVV Indore](http://ietdavv.edu.in/ "IET DAVV, Indore"). I was born and brought up in Bhopal, MP and I am currently studying in Indore, MP. 

I recently got introduced to the world of open source and I haven’t looked back since. I absolutely love the idea of open source software and am thouroughly enjoying it. I am trying my part to [contribute](https://github.com/saurabhshri "My Github Profile.") as I learn :) It feels amazing to know that my contribution is _actually_ out there and people are using it.

My proposal for creating a tool for _word by word audio subtitle synchronization_ has been [accepted](https://saurabhshri.github.io/2017/05/gsoc/accepted-in-google-summer-of-code-2017 "Accepted in Google Summer of Code 2017!") for Google Summer of Code, 2017 with the amazing organization - [CCExtractor Development](https://ccextractor.org), and I will be spending my summer building it. :)

This blog will be the place where I primarily log my GSoC progress. It currently has {{ site.posts | size }} posts in {{ site.categories | size }} categories which combinedly have {{ total_words }} words, which will take an average reader ({{ site.wpm }} WPM) approximately <span class="time">{{ total_readtime }}</span> minutes to read. {% if featuredcount != 0 %}There are <a href="{{ site.url }}/featured">{{ featuredcount }} featured posts</a>, you should definitely check those out.{% endif %} The most recent post is {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% if post.description %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% else %}<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.description }}" title="Read more about {{ post.title }}">"{{ post.title }}"</a>{% endif %}{% endfor %} which was published on {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}{% assign modifiedtime = post.modified | date: "%Y%m%d" %}{% assign posttime = post.date | date: "%Y%m%d" %}<time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" class="post-time">{{ post.date | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% if post.modified %}{% if modifiedtime != posttime %} and last modified on <time datetime="{{ post.modified | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}" itemprop="dateModified">{{ post.modified | date: "%d %b %Y" }}</time>{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}. The last commit was on {{ site.time | date: "%A, %d %b %Y" }} at {{ site.time | date: "%I:%M %p" }} [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Temps Universel Coordonné").

At some point in the not-terribly-distant future, I hope to become a good and professional software developer. I am learning as I try and explore things.
